To install simply clone the repo and run 

```
cabal build
```

Yet, it requires `ghc-9.12.2` (suggested to install via [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/)) and [`Z3`](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)!

If these requirements are high, you can follow the Fibonacci example from the Liquid Haskell online demo: [Fibonacci.hs](https://liquidhaskell.goto.ucsd.edu/index.html#?demo=permalink%2F1759159462_1108.hs)
